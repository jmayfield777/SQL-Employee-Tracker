# SQL-Employee-Tracker

## Description

This project is a CLI Content Management System (CMS) using mysql and inquirer. To start, the user must navigate to the folder holding the index.js file on their local computer. Once in the correct folder, run node index.js to start the CLI. The user will be greeted with a plethora of options (View All Employees, Add Employee, Update Employee Role, Remove Employee, View All Roles, Add Role, View All Departments, View Employees By Department, Add Department, and Quit). Using your arrow keys, choose which option you would like and press enter. After pressing enter a table will be logged to the console displaying results or further inquirer prompts will be displayed to continue your query. Press the last prompt, Quit, to exit out of the CLI application.
